# Advent of Code 2025 solvers in Rust

Warning! Potential spoilers! If you're not familiar with [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2025/about) check it out and see if you want to participate by coming up with your own solvers before reviewing mine.

This year I've been learning Rust so naturally I'm doing the AoC in it. I'm still not terribly familiar with all of its features or available crates so I won't be putting much effort into a CLI to select a solver or enter input. To keep it simple, all my solvers will live in lib.rs and then I'll use main.rs to run the solver I currently want an answer from, loading my input from an input.txt file. I will be trying to balance performance and readability. Every solver will have doc comments explaining my approach, iterative attempts, and any other anecdotes I come up with along the way.
